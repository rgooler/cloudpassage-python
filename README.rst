===================

*NOTICE* This is no longer being maintained, as cloudpassage has an official python API

*cloudpassage-python* is a simple MIT-licensed Python module for easily communicating with the CloudPassage API.

It is run and tested on Python 2.7, and probably works on others. Testing / pull requests are greatly appreciated!
